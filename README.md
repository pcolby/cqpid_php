cqpid_php
=========

A [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)-based [Qpid Messaging API]
(http://qpid.apache.org/components/messaging-api/index.html) binding for PHP.

This is really just a more accessible (ie searchable, browsable) copy of
code I contributed to the [Apache Qpid](http://qpid.apache.org/) project
as [QPID-3027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-3027).

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-3027 for more details.
